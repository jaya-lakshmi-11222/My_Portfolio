<h2>Hello, I'm Jaya Lakshmi Gunnam. I laid the foundation of my academic journey at ZPPH School, Jonnada. where I successfully completed my SSC with a notable 9.0 GPA. My educational voyage continued at Vignan Junior College, Mandapeta. where I pursued my intermediate studies and achieved a commendable 75%.
<br></br>
Currently, I find myself immersed in the dynamic field of technology as a third-year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence with Data Science. Motivated by self-discipline and fueled by a strong work ethic. I consider myself a self-motivated and diligent individual.
<br></br>
Beyond academics, I have a passion for exploring the latest technologies and indulging in the rhythm of music during my leisure time. As I navigate through the challenges of academia, my short-term goal is to secure a position in a reputable company. Looking ahead, my long-term aspiration is to not only make my parents proud but also embark on a world tour, gaining diverse experiences along the way.</h2>
